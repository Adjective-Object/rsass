# rsass-macros

Sass reimplemented in rust with nom.
The "r" in the name might stand for the Rust programming language, for
"re-implemented", or possibly for my name Rasmus.

This is the `rsass-macros` crate, giving rust projects access to
sass-compiled strings in compile-time.
To use it, add `rsass-macros` to your dependencies in a rust project.

    cargo add rsass-macros
